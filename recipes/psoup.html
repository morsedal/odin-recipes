        <h2>The best Potato Soup recipe ever!</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love a good potato soup? We're coming up to the fall and this recipe will warm you right up!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 pound of bacon</li>
                <li>1 28oz bag potatos O'brien with onions and peppers</li>
                <li>30oz chicken broth</li>
                <li>8 oz garlic and herb cheese spread</li>
                <li>1 pinch of black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop roughly when cool enough to handle.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, pour potatoes into the same skillet, and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove potatoes to a slow cooker. Stir in chicken broth. Dollop cheese spread on top; scatter bacon on top. Cover slow cooker and cook on High until potatoes are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
                <li>If desired, ladle some of the soup, no more than halfway full, into a high powered blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds.</li>
                <li>Pour soup back into slow cooker. Stir to combine; serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
